A tortilla chip is a snack food made from corn tortillas, which are cut into triangles and then friedâ€”or baked (alternatively they may be discs pressed out of corn masa then fried or baked). Corn tortillas are made of corn, vegetable oil, salt and water. Although first mass-produced commercially in the U.S. in Los Angeles in the late 1940s,[1] tortilla chips grew out of Mexican cuisine, where similar items were well known, such as totopos and tostadas.[2] Though usually made of yellow corn, they can also be made of white, blue, or red corn. Some manufacturers include many other ingredients including wheat, sugar, food colouring, and monosodium glutamate.[citation needed]
